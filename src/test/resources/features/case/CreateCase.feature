Feature: Creation funtional and acceptance

  @CaseCreation
  Scenario: Create an case with minimun data required
    Given user fills the request case with the data required
      | type | case01 |
    When user creates a case with the type
    Then the status code case is a number 201
    And schema case "case creation schema" is valid

  @CaseCreation @Funtional
  Scenario Outline: User creates multiple cases with type and status data
  by specifying at least a status and priority
    Given user specifies case body content
      | type   | <type>   |
      | Status | <Status> |
    When user posts to case endpoint
    Then the status code case is a number 201
    And response includes the following
      | success | true |
    And response complies case create 201 schema
    Examples:
      | type       | Status    |
      | Mechanical | New       |
      | Electrical | Working   |
      | Electronic | Escalated |
      | Structural | Closed    |
      | Other      | --None--  |

  @CaseCreation @Funtional
  Scenario Outline: User creates multiple cases with Priority and status data
  by specifying at least a status and priority
    Given user specifies case body content

    When user posts to case endpoint
    Then the status code case is a number 201
    And response includes the following
      | success | true |
    And response complies case create 201 schema
    Examples:
      | Priority | Status    |
      | Medium   | New       |
      | Medium   | Working   |

    When user posts to case endpoint
    Then the status code case is a number 201
    And response includes the following
      | success | true |
    And response complies case create 201 schema
    Examples:
      | Origin   | Status    |

      | --None-- | --None--  |

  @CaseCreation @Funtional
  Scenario Outline: User creates multiple cases with case reason and status data
  by specifying at least a status and priority
    Given user specifies case reason body content
      | Reason | <Reason> |
    When user posts to case endpoint
    Then the status code case is a number 201
    And response includes the following
      | success | true |
    And response complies case create 201 schema
    Examples:
      | Reason               |
      | Installation         |
      | Equipment Complexity |
      | Performance          |
      | Breakdown            |
      | Equipment Design     |
      | Feedback             |
      | Other                |
      | --None--             |

  @CaseCreation @Funtional
  Scenario Outline: User creates multiple cases with four case fields and status data
  by specifying at least a status and priority
